      min_z: -0.85    # Points with Z < "val" will be excluded. (slightly below the ground to account for any mounting height)

      max_z: 0.85     # Points with Z > "val" will be excluded. (slightly above the vehicle to account for the roof and mounting height)
      
      negative: true  # Set to true to invert the CropBox filter, filtering points inside the defined box.
